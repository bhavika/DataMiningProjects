1. Using KMeans_naive with euclidean distance gives me 147 entries and 0.48 on leaderboard
2. Using KMeans_naive with cosine distance gives 147 entries and 0.60 on leaderboard (always subtract cosine similarity from 1)
3. KMeans with Manhattan distance gives the worst results

4. KMeans with PCA where components  = 5 is in file predictions/kmeans_pca_1.txt, gives 0.18 on leaderboard.
5. KMeans with PCA where components  = 10 is in file predictions/kmeans_pca_2.txt, gives 0.34 on leaderboard
6. KMeans with PCA where components = 20 is in file predictions/kmeans_pca_3.txt, gives 0.29 on leaderboard
